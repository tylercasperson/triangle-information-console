# Triangle Information Console

## This is my first c# app I have added to github. The tasks required made C# an easy language to learn. I am sure there are more advance techniques that can be used.

## To run the app:

- git clone
- cd to the location of the app
- cd to:
  triangle-information-console/bin/Release/netcoreapp3.1
- in the console type: dotnet triangle-information-console.dll
- the program will start

I was asked to create an application to tell more information about a triangle. The user would input 3 numbers (the length of each side). My app was to let them know what type of triangle would be produced.

## I created the exact same thing as a web application. Here is the link: [triangle information using react](https://tylercasperson.github.io/triangle-information/)
